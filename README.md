# Lattices In Cryptography

These are lecture notes from my graduate-level Lattices in
Cryptography seminar course, taught at the University of Michigan
(Winter 2026, Fall 2022 and 2015) and previously at Georgia Tech (Fall
2013).

See also my expository survey "A Decade of Lattice Cryptography", at
https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~cpeikert/pubs/lattice-survey.pdf

The notes are a work in progress, will be updated irregularly, and may
contain (hopefully minor) errors, typos, etc. Pull requests are
welcome!
